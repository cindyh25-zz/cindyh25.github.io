      <p><strong>Automatic pairings:</strong> Putting yourself out there is hard. A virtual, one-on-one introduction
        every week invites students to get to know each other better.</p>
      <p><strong>Matching based on similarities:</strong> With common ground, people are more likely to follow
        through with pairings have a positive experience during the meet-up.</p>
      <p><strong>More friends, less “clout”:</strong> There is enough peer pressure and resources around
        professional development already. We hope to challenge this and create a comfortable space focused on making
        new friends.</p>

        <h2>Why do we need Pear?</h2>
        <p>Too often at Cornell, we pass by other students we vaguely know, drift apart from people, or even don’t
          know the names of others in the same student club. Within our project team we’ve found that 30 minute chats
          can help people learn about each other, improve culture, and sometimes lead to life-long friendships. </p>
        <p>After a few semesters of coffee-chatting each other we saw an opportunity to for everyone at Cornell to
          break awkward barriers and improve campus culture.</p>
        <p><strong>But what do other students think?</strong></p>
        <p>We interviewed and surveyed other Cornell undergraduates about how they feel about their community and
          relationships with other students. Here are highlights of what we learned:</p>
      </div>
      <div class="row center-row">
        <div class="col-3"><img class="img-fluid" src="assets/pear/userresearch-1.png" /></div>
        <div class="col-9">
          <p>Many people have close friends but also many other acquaintances that they wish they knew better.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="row center-row">
        <div class="col-3"><img class="img-fluid" src="assets/pear/userresearch-2.png" /></div>
        <div class="col-9">
          <p>Everyone is open to chatting, but don’t want to reach out due to laziness or fear of inconveniencing
            others.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>The Problem</h2>
        <p class="people-problem green">
          Cornell students want to form meaningful connections with other students who share interests and hobbies.
          But this is difficult because:
        </p>
        <ul class="people-problem green">
          <li>They do not know how to initiate the interaction.</li>
          <li>They are not used to branching out beyond their current circle.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="new-section">Listening to how other students struggled to deepen their friendships or find the time
          and energy to meet
          new people helped us narrow down the goals for our product:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Connect people with common interests and groups</li>
          <li>Minimize the friction of reaching out and scheduling meetups</li>

          constraints and product direction.</p>

    <div class="row">
      <div class="col">
        <h5>Constraints</h5>
        <ul>

        <h2>Personalization</h2>
        <p>First, we need some information about the students to pair them up with others who have common ground to
          talk about. This content also helps students learn a bit about each other before meeting up. We based the
          onboarding flow on how students feel more excited and comfortable meeting new people with similar
          background, interests, or campus groups. We also want to give people a way to connect or communicate outside
          of the app, since messaging is outside of our constraints.</p>

        <p>This cycle of pairings solves three problems students experience:</p>
        <ul>

          <li>Struggling to craft intro messages asking to meet with someone they don’t know</li>

        <p>Ultimately, we decided to highlight similarities with a clear destinction and label and give thorough
          information on the other person’s background and appearance build trust before deciding to meet up.</p>

          Scheduling
        </h2>
        <p>Students have the most frustration with deciding when and where to meet in our busy schedules. Many
          complained about having to communicate back and forth, or even not getting a response at all.</p>
        <p>Minimizing the friction for scheduling will reduce the barrier for meet-ups. That way, users can focus more
          on building relationships rather than scheduling.</p>

    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-4">
        <h5>Initial Approach</h5>
        <p>We thought that due to everyone’s busy schedules, students would want to change their availability each
          week. </p>

      <div class="col-4">
        <h5>Revised Approach</h5>
        <p>However, we realized that students still have typical routines that would be tedious to repeatedly enter.
          Our revised approach lets them input this once and pre-fill it when reaching out.</p>

        <h2>Looking forward</h2>
        <p>Unfortunately, COVID-19 abruptly interrupted our team’s in-person workflow and Pear will be released in
          Fall 2020. However, we were still able to conduct remote user testing with our prototype. We
          gained valuable feedback that sparked ideas of how to improve, including: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Revisiting content strategy
          </li>
          <li>Creating a space for
            instant messaging</li>
          <li>A community feed of successful meetups to encourage following through with them</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The pandemic also may change people’s attitude or ability to participate in in-person meetings with strangers
          😢. As it unfolds,
          the team will keep this in mind in shaping our product. However, we are optimistic that there will always be
          a need to feel connected with the community, whether that will be at a campus cafe, over video calls, or
          some other solution. </p>

        <h2>What I learned</h2>
        <p><strong>Tight knit collaboration.</strong> Thanks to constant and thoughtful feedback from other
          designers and our developers, I learned to not only respond at lightning speed to Slack messages, but also
          appreciate different perspectives and improve my design work as a result.</p>
        <p><strong>Designing on a mission.</strong> I truly loved spending so much time thinking about ways to improve
          the Cornell community. I learned that wholeheatedly believing in the mission of a product fuels my
          productivity and creativity.</p>
        <p><strong>Scrap that!</strong> We made countless mistakes and iterations that will never see the light. But
          pushing through those challenged us to think of other edge cases and possibilities and ultimately create a
          better app. I can’t wait to see where it goes 🚀</p>
        <p><strong>Bonus:</strong> I loved exploring illustration and branding as well! Here’s
          some of the visuals up close.</p>
