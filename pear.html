        <h2>Why do we need Pear?</h2>
        <p>Too often at Cornell, we pass by other students we vaguely know, drift apart from people, or even don’t
          know the names of others in the same campus group. Within our project team we’ve found that 30 minute chats
          can help people learn about each other, improve culture, and sometimes lead to life-long friendships. </p>
        <p>After a few semesters of coffee-chatting each other we saw an opportunity to for everyone at Cornell to
          break awkward barriers and improve campus culture.</p>
        <p><strong>But what do other students think?</strong></p>
        <p>We interviewed and surveyed other Cornell undergraduates about how they feel about their community and
          relationships with other students. Here are highlights of what we learned:</p>
      </div>
      <div class="row center-row">
        <div class="col-md-3 col-xs-12"><img class="img-fluid" src="assets/pear/userresearch-1.png" /></div>
        <div class="col-md-9 col-xs-12">
          <p>Many people have close friends but also lots of other acquaintances that they wish they knew better.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="row center-row">
        <div class="col-md-3 col-xs-12"><img class="img-fluid" src="assets/pear/userresearch-2.png" /></div>
        <div class="col-md-9 col-xs-12">
          <p>Everyone is open to chatting, but don’t want to reach out due to laziness or fear of inconveniencing
            others.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="row center-row">

        <h2>The Problem</h2>
        <p class="people-problem green">
          Cornell students want to form meaningful connections with particular students.
          But this is difficult because:
        </p>
        <ul class="people-problem green">
          <li>The Cornell community feels isolating.</li>
          <li>They do not know how to initiate the interaction.</li>
          <li>They are not used to branching out beyond their current circle.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="new-section">Listening to how other students struggled to deepen their friendships or find the time
          and energy to meet
          new people helped us narrow down the goals for our product:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Connect people with common interests and groups</li>
          <li>Minimize the friction of reaching out and scheduling meetups</li>

        <h2>Where to start</h2>
        <p>After discussing with our team of superstar designers, engineers, and strategists we decided on some
          constraints and product direction.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col">
        <h5>Constraints</h5>
        <ul>

      <div class="col">
        <h2>Personalization</h2>
        <p>First, we need some information about the students to pair them up with others who have common ground to
          talk about. This content also helps students learn a bit about each other before meeting up. We based the
          onboarding flow on how students feel more excited and comfortable meeting new people with similar
          background, interests, or campus groups. We also want to give people a way to connect or communicate outside
          of the app, since messaging is outside of our constraints.</p>

        <p>This cycle of automatic pairings solves three problems students experience:</p>

        <p>We explored different hierarchies of the pair's profile picture, demographic information, interests, and
          groups and also considered not showing the photo altogether. Ultimately, we decided to highlight similarities
          with a clear distinction and label and give thorough
          information on the other person’s background. Though appearance shouldn't matter to in meeting new friends,
          being able to also see the other student's photo can build
          trust before deciding to meet up.</p>

          Scheduling
        </h2>
        <p>Students have the most frustration with deciding when and where to meet in our busy schedules. Many
          complained about having to communicate back and forth, or even not getting a response at all.</p>
        <p>Minimizing the friction for scheduling will reduce the barrier for meet-ups. That way, users can
          <strong>focus more
            on building relationships rather than logistics.</strong></p>

    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-md-4  col-xs-12">
        <h4>Initial Approach</h4>
        <p>We thought that due to everyone’s busy schedules, students would want to change their availability
          <strong>every
            week.</strong> </p>
      </div>

        <h4>Revised Approach</h4>
        <p>However, we realized that students still have typical routines that would be tedious to repeatedly enter.
          Our revised approach lets them <strong>input it once and modify later</strong> it when reaching out.</p>

        <p>First, we rapidly iterated on the interactions of selecting when and where to meet.</p>

        <img class="img-fluid" src="assets/pear/scheduling02.png" />

        <h4 class="subsection">Explorations: Round two</h4>
        <p>After receiving critiques, we iterated on the third option with a more streamlined navigation. We also
          focused more on the content in these screens, since we previously struggled to convey the individual time and
          locations
          effectively and visually. Simultaneously, we worked on creating a visual design system for the app which is
          reflected in this later stage. </p>
        <img class="img-fluid" src="assets/pear/scheduling04.png" />
        <p>Though this provided a clearer way of communicating and selecting days of the week, times in each day, and a
          wider range of locations, we decided that the flow could be more efficient by combining the first two screens.
          Though separating them could be less overwhelming at first, the content is so similar that we felt students
          might want to edit the days and times of their availability seamlessly. </p>

          around the fruit.</p>
        <p>Our pear friend gives updates and reminders about pairings and scheduled meetups. It helps
          <strong>prevent bad

      <h2>Looking forward</h2>
      <p>Unfortunately, COVID-19 abruptly interrupted our team’s in-person workflow, but we are still working hard and
        plan to ship at the beginning of Spring 2021. We were still able to conduct remote user testing with our
        prototype and
        gained valuable feedback that sparked ideas of how to improve, including: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Building a community through Pear
        </li>
        <li>Tailoring parings to students' specific goals</li>
        <li>Modifying scheduling locations to encourage safe, distanced chats</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The pandemic has definitely people’s attitude or ability to participate in in-person meetings with strangers
        😢. We will keep this in mind in shaping our product. However, <strong>we are optimistic that there will always
          be
          a need to feel connected with the community, whether that will be at a campus cafe, over video calls, or
          some other solution.</strong> </p>
