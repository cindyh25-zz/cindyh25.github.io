    <h6>Motivation üç©</h6>
    Everyone loves free food, especially college students low on meal swipes. We love giving and receiving
    free food so much so that the students of Cornell University created a group chat in GroupMe with <strong>
      over 4K members</strong> and <strong>dozens of messages every day</strong> solely to share about free
    food offerings on campus.<br><br>
    People use this group chat for mainly four reasons:
    <ul>
      <li>Finding when, where, and what kind of free food is being given out on campus</li>
      <li>Publicizing student organizations' events</li>
      <li>Asking whether the food has run out or is worth the trek/wait</li>
      <li>Getting rid of leftover food</li>
    </ul>

    <h6>
      The Problem ü§î
    </h6>
    However, there are also problems with this method of communication.<br>

    <div class="pic" style="width:33%;">
      <img src="/assets/foodie/screenshot-3.png" alt="Screenshot of disorganized chat">
      <p class="small">
        The chat is cluttered with irrelevant content (people leaving and joining)
      </p>
    </div>
    <br><br>
    Members cannot filter the notifications from a group chat, so most members that I spoke to have the group
    on mute and rarely check the messages. The chat also includes a lot of irrelevant activity, such as people
    joining and leaving the group. Ultimately, the group is an overload of information that makes it hard to
    digest.<br><br>
    From the conversations I had with students, I learned that people won't go out of the way or plan ahead to
    get free food, but it is a good way to save money or get some light fuel throughout the day.
    <div class="emphasis">
      People want free food that is convenient for them, and student organizations want to attract more people
      to their events by providing food. But, this is hard¬†because:<br><br>
      It's hard to find offerings nearby or on the¬†way.<br><br>
      The group chat is annoying and cumbersome to keep checking.
    </div>
    So, for the three-week <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cornellappdev.com/hack-challenge" class="underline">
      CU AppDev Hack Challenge</a>, my group set out to create a way to:
    <ol>
      <li>Easily find and sort through all of the convenient free food events offered</li>
      <li>Better organize how information about free food is delivered so people can quickly scan for relevant
        information</li>
      <li>Update event info in real time</li>
    </ol>

    <h6>
      Ideation üìù
    </h6>
    To replace the free food GroupMe, our app had to be organized and simple to understand. We brainstormed different
    features
    such as a map or a calendar and evaluated the use cases and problems that each idea had.<br>
    <div class="pic">
      <img src="/assets/foodie/Ideation.png">
    </div>

    At this point, I had questions about students' habits and tendencies surrounding free food events.
    When and why do they care about free food (if at all)? What helps them decide whether to eat at
    a free food event or use money? Do they plan to go to these events ahead of time or decide spontaneously? To find
    out which features would be most valuable to students, I interviewed four college students. Here are the trends and
    insights I found:
    <ul>
      <li><b>Free food is a spontaneous decision.</b> Students do not plan to eat free food ahead of time, and only look
        to the GroupMe if they are
        hungry in the moment, don't have other plans, and want to save money.</li>
      <li><b>Students already know their way around campus.</b> They would like to know what events are close to them,
        but don't need help navigating there.</li>
      <li><b>Students' priority when looking for free food is convenience.</b> They go to these events out of interest
        for the event or if the food
        is close in distance, on their way, or happening at the moment when they start feeling hungry.</li>
    </ul>
    Based on these findings, I evaluated the above features in terms of feasibility and impact on students. I chose to
    pursue the feed format, and brainstormed more specific features and functionality to fill students' needs.<br>

    <div class="pic">
      <img src="/assets/foodie/feasibility.png">
      <p class="small">

      </p>
    </div>

    A real-time feed of free food postings was the most feasible and valuable for students' needs. It could provide the
    functionality of searching for
    events by location and time and also fit with the mental model of spontaneity of the current group chat in a more
    organized format. The calendar doesn't fit students'
    tendency to spontaneously decide to look for free food, and the map navigation also wouldn't be as valuable since
    students already know their way around buildings.
    Though people care about the distance and time of events, a filter function for the feed could fill that need while
    fitting within our engineering constraints.

    <br><br>
    Next, I mapped out the flow and hierarchy of the app and how we'd implement browsing, filtering, and posting in the
    feed.<br>

    </div>

    <h6>
      Develop üì≤
    </h6>
    I read through many messages and food postings in the current group chat and evaluated what content was most
    clear and informative, and what caused follow up questions and confusion. Once I had an idea of the content that is
    absolutely essential and extra content that could be optional, but still helpful, I laid out the quick-view for the
    main feed as well as a detailed view.<br>
    <div class="pic">
      <img src="/assets/foodie/content-requirements.png" alt="Content requirements">
      <p class="small">
        Information displayed for each event in a consistent, easily scannable format
      </p>
    </div>

    Next, I decided how to organize the main feed. To simplify and streamline the app, I knew we wanted a
    main feed of upcoming event sorted by those happening soonest. Free food is usually a spontaneous decision,
    rather than a planned out meal.
    But, since students experience frustration when messages get lost or buried in the current group chat, we also
    wanted to allow people to save an event to easily find later.<br><br>
    Besides upcoming and saved events, another distinct type of event is those created by the user.
    A student might want to update or end the event to let people know food has run out. I explored various ways
    to separate and organize the student's own events so that they can view, edit, or update them.<br>

    <p class="small">
      "My Events" iterations
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="text">
    I originally proposed option A and split the feed into three tabs. But, the "By Me" tab would often
    be empty and useless for many users who do not post. It felt too heavy to have an entire tab dedicated to this.<br>
    Option D's bottom navigation is similar to A, except I changed the "Events By Me" page into a user profile with
    added features.
    In an ideal world, this would provide the most functionality with the option to set a user's notification
    preferences. However, due to our limited time for this hack challenge, I decided that C would allow for prominent
    access to the events created by the user without an entirely separate page.<br><br>

    During the Hack Challenge, I treated this project as a 3-day design sprint to give the team most of the time to
    develop.

      here,</a> based off of my earlier designs.<br>
    <br><br>
    <h6>Reflection üßê</h6>
    This project started as a silly and fun idea thrown out during our first brainstorming session, and turned into a
    very rewarding
    project. It was my first time ideating and designing an app from start to finish. Though we were not able to
    implement every feature desired (such as updating events and notifications), there were many lessons learned!
    <ul>
      <li><strong>üìû The importance of communication. </strong>Our team was made up of busy students getting through
        midterm
        season, so communication was critical. Making sure we met in person and held each other accountable was the main
        reason
        we were able to create an awesome product as beginners during a busy time period. </li>
      <li><strong>‚è∞ Working with constraints. </strong>The biggest constraint for this project was time. My team was
        concerned about
        finishing the project on time on top of their other responsibilities. So, my top priority was getting the
        designs ready quickly.
        I also had to work with engineering restraints, since some of our desired features were outside of the scope of
        the engineers'
        knowledge as first time app developers.</li>
      <li><strong>üôãüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Taking ownership. </strong>My group members spent the semester learning how to engineer an
        app,
        but had no exposure to how product design plays into creating a successful product. I learned to
        explain
        my thinking and process, and to back up my design decisions with reason and intentionality.</li>
    </ul>
