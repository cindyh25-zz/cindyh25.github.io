    <h4 class="new-section">Motivation ❔</h4>
    <p>
      At Cornell, many professors utilize polling software such as iClickers or Learning Catalytics in class.
      They use this often in large lectures where <strong>it is hard to interact with everyone in the class</strong>.
      Some
      of the main motivations for polling during class are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Taking attendance</li>
      <li>Gauging the class’ understanding of material</li>
      <li>Engaging students during class in an interactive way</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The goal of Pollo is to provide a <em>free</em> alternative to polling software through a mobile and web app. In
      order to compete with other software and get Pollo into classrooms, we wanted to investigate whether professors
      prefer a desktop interface to
      run polls during class.
    </p>


    <h4 class="subsection">My Contribution</h4>
    <p>
      I created prototypes and a <strong>user testing</strong> protocol to explore the
      opportunity for a <strong>web app</strong>. During the Fall 2019 semester I also worked on creating a <a
        href="https://www.figma.com/file/C9mZz5wT7GVyOmpVqfPgCi/pollo-system?node-id=134%3A105" class="underline"
        target="_blank">design system</a> and improving the mobile polling experience for
      students and professors.
    </p>

    <h2 class="new-section">Why web?</h2>
    <p>We hypothesized that professors would only adopt Pollo if it had a web interface because:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Professors might not be excited or accustomed to using theirs phones to run their course</li>
      <li>Students might not all have a mobile device on them in class</li>
      <li>Running polls might be more familiar on a desktop platform, based on current apps</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We went into testing with simple prototypes so that we could get professor's real reactions to a potential tool,
      rather than just hypothesizing how they feel about polling.</p>
    <p><strong>Our goals for the study:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Learn about professor's workflow and attitudes towards polling</li>
      <li>Find pain points in using prototypes and ways to improve</li>
      <li>Hear about concerns around adopting Pollo in professor's classes</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="new-section">Participants</h2>
    <p>We sent an initial survey to Cornell professors to learn about the classes they teach, how they incorporate
      polling in them, and how interested they are in a new alternative. We reached out to the 11 professors who
      responded and interviewed three who volunteered. The interviewees taught large courses in Economics, Computer
      Science, and Information Science.</p>

      <h2 class="new-section">Further interview questions</h2>
      <p>These are the questions we asked during user testing sessions to dive deeper than the survey questions.</p>
      <h4 class="subsection">
        1. Context
      </h4>
      <p>Talk about goals of the session, Pollo at a high level, and consent.</p>

      <h4 class="subsection">
        2. Background Questions
      </h4>
      <p>Debrief responses to the initial survey and ask if they would like to elaborate.</p>

      <h4 class="subsection">3. Grading and Exporting</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Describe how you determine grades from poll results.
          <ul>
            <li>
              Just participation or based on correctness?
            </li>
            <li>
              Are all questions weighted the same?
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Where do you export grades to? (Canvas, CMS, …)</li>
        <li>How often do you export grades to CMS or Canvas?</li>
      </ul>

      <h4 class="subsection">4. Planning and Live Polling</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>How do you plan questions for a lecture?</li>
        <li>Around how many questions do you have per lecture?</li>
        <li>Would you take time to type up questions or are they already in lecture slides?</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="new-section">Crafting the prototypes</h2>
      <p>We decided the first stage of development would be helping professors run polls from their desktop before
        designing the student side. From prior research when creating the mobile app, we learned that exporting
        attendance
        for their grading software and being able to easily make and start polls are the top priorities for professors.
      </p>

      <h4>Explorations</h4>
      <p>Amanda and I worked to together to create a few high level explorations of the layout translating the mobile
        app to web.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="container-fluid">
      <img class="img-fluid" src="assets/pollo/explorations.png" alt="High level explorations of Pollo web" />
    </div>

    <div class="container-md casestudy-container">
      <p>We decided to go with <strong>Iteration 1</strong> because it had the most familiarity with the mobile app. It
        also
        allows for consistency since the sidebar could be easily modified to display classes, sessions, and questions.
        However, we needed to add an intermediate dashboard for a group for professors to view and export data. </p>

      <h2 class="new-section">Final prototypes and Testing scenarios</h2>
      <h4>1. Making questions</h4>
      <p>This flow tests whether professors understand how to create groups for their classes and individual sessions
        with
        questions for each lecture.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="container-fluid">
      <img class="img-fluid" src="assets/pollo/Prototype 01.png" />
    </div>

    <div class="container-md casestudy-container">
      <h4 class="new-section">2. Live polling</h4>
      <p>This flow continues from the last to test if professors understand how to run polls.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="container-fluid">
      <img class="img-fluid" src="assets/pollo/Prototype 02.png" />
    </div>

    <div class="container-md casestudy-container">
      <h4 class="new-section">3. Quick Add</h4>
      <p>This is an experimental feature that tests whether professors find value in an alternate flow for creating
        questions. Quick add allows question creation on the fly with generic question names and automatic A-D multiple
        choices.</p>

      <h2 class="new-section">Trends</h2>

      <h4 class="subsection">Concerns</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Where is the students' data going?</li>
        <li>Switching between presentation display and web app can be disruptive</li>
      </ul>

      <h4 class="subsection">Grading</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Typically use polling as just as a participation and attendance grade</li>
        <li>Grading schemes for participation still varies</li>
        <li>Syncing up iClicker data with Canvas/CMS is a pain-- exporting data with no issues would be amazing!
        </li>
        <li>Export a few times per semester, but need to check frequently if students want to know their grades</li>
      </ul>

      <h4 class="subsection">Planning and Live Polling</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Not used to lining up questions in advance-- most questions are already written out somewhere else, not
          in the polling software</li>
        <li>Confusion when marking a correct answer and saving question drafts</li>
        <li>Quick Add would be useful to create questions on the spot</li>
        <li>Often make mistakes in lecture and would like to restart, skip, etc.</li>
      </ul>


      <h2 class="new-section">Insights</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Professors need flexibilty during live polling and in exporting data for grading. Professors plan their
          polls in
          advance, but would also like to be able to revise things on the spot and not have to stick strictly to the
          plan. They also may weight questions a certain way or use different grading software and need flexibility in
          the format that Pollo exports data.</li>
        <li>Though professors didn't have trouble live polling with the prototype, lecture hall facilities also have
          various physical
          constraints that can affect whether professors can run the app seamlessly with the technology
          they have.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="new-section">Impact</h2>
      <p>This study helped next semester's designers, Femi and Renee, to iterate on the question creation and
        exporting flows throughout Spring 2020. <strong><a href="http://pollo.cornellappdev.com/" target="_blank"
            class="underline">Pollo web</a>
          was shipped in May</strong> (along with the iOS and Android apps) and the team is in touch with Cornell
        professors to use
        it in their classes! We are super excited, especially during a pandemic, to provide a
        free polling alternative that isn't restricted to being in a physical classroom. </p>

      <h2 class="new-section">What next?</h2>
      <p>We got some great responses from the professors we talked to, and even some wanting to test Pollo next
        semester. We will revisit some interactions when creating polls such as marking correct answers and adding
        questions, but also look forward to new opportunity areas. Some ideas on the list:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Allowing restarting, skipping, and Quick Add for polls
        </li>
        <li>
          A popup window to display results as graphs for the class
        </li>
        <li>
          A class roster to view attendance data without having to export it
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="new-section" id="bottom">What I learned </h2>
      <p><strong>Designing for someone else.</strong> I had no idea of what it was like to lecture 300 students.
        Speaking with the professors who would be using Pollo taught me how to empathize
        with users who have a drastically different experience from myself.</p>
      <p><strong>Choosing the right tool for the job.</strong> I prototyped in Figma, which turned out to
        be a good level of realism and simplicity. We could simulate the app's interactions while not investing too much
        time and energy in a prototype that might not be the final build.</p>
