    <h6>Motivation ‚ùî</h6>
    At Cornell, many professors utilize polling software such as iClickers or Learning Catalytics in class.
    They use this often in large lectures where it is hard to interact with everyone in the class. Some
    of the main motivations for polling during class are:
    <ul>
      <li>Taking attendance</li>
      <li>Gauging the class‚Äô understanding</li>
      <li>Engaging students during class</li>
    </ul>

    <h6>
      The Problem ü§î
    </h6>
    Widely used polling software is <strong>expensive</strong> and/or <strong>bulky.</strong><br>
    <img src="assets/pollo-problem.png">

    <br><br>
    This can be a financial burden and an annoyance to carry around or sign up/register for.
    <div class="emphasis">
      How might we create a way for professors to easily track and interact with students and for students to
      participate in classes, for free?
    </div>
    As part of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cornellappdev.com/" class="underline">
      Cornell AppDev</a>, my contributions as a product designer have been:

    </ol>

    <h2 id="design-system">
      1. Visual Design System üé®
    </h2>
    <p>
      The team lacked a consistent UI kit. I did an audit of all of the visual assets in the app, consolidated styles
      into
      a visual design system created using Figma, and updated the old designs using this system. <br>
    </p>

    <p style="margin-top:2em;">
      This helped us resolve many inconsistencies in our designs/visual hierarchy and organize our files. In the future,
      we will use Figma components'
      best practices to design more efficiently and hand off clean and consistent designs to developers!

    <h2 id="onboarding">
      2. Onboarding üö¢
    </h2>
    We wanted to create an onboarding flow for the first time a user makes a poll to make sure they know of all options.
    Particularly, that
    <ul>
      <li>Starting a question without inputting anything will autofill with choices "A", "B", etc.</li>
      <li>Selecting an option marks it as a correct answer.</li>
      <li>You can either save the question to poll later (planning lectures in advance) or start polling on the spot.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h6>
      Here is the final prototype.
    </h6>
    <video width="100%" controls>
      <source src="assets/onboarding-video.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
    <h6>
      Here is how I got there.
    </h6>
    <p>
      First, I mapped out different orderings and lengths of the onboarding flow to mimic how a professor would make a
      poll
      themselves and make it easy to follow.
    </p>
    <img class="pic" src="assets/onboarding-flows.png">

    <p>
      I decided on <strong>Flow 3</strong> because it was the most comprehensive, highlighting all features without
      unecessary steps.
      It also presented the autofill option more as a secondary option to filling out each question. I chose this
      because prior research showed
      the primary use case is for professors planning out questions in advance rather than on the spot. The autofill is
      still important if professors
      poll spontaneously or have questions on the lecture slides that don't fit within our length/format constraints to
      display on the app.
    </p>
    <h6>
      Visual explorations
    </h6>
    <p>
      I also explored how to visually highlight both the specific parts of the screen (buttons, text fields, etc.) and
      the text for
      onboarding instructions. I used a gray overlay and white outlines and text to emphasize components and provide
      context.
    </p>
    <img class="pic" src="assets/onboarding-visual.png">
    <p>
      Option A is more dynamic which brings users' attention to the buttons highlighted. But, the copy is less direct
      and the motion
      does not leave a good space for a "tap to continue" prompt. <br>
      Option B makes the text the primary focus with a heavier weight, fixed position, and simple copy. <br><br>
      I chose <strong>A</strong> based on feedback that the moving instructions provides clearer focus on where to click
      and
      how to navigate.<br><br>

      3. Iterating on user testing üë∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

      These iterations will be a part of our next launch on iOS and Android. <br>

      4. Designing Pollo for web üíª
    </h2>
    <p>
      To address professor's desire for more group controls and hesitance to allow phones in class, we are currently
      working
      on building a Pollo web app.<br><br>
      Our main goal for a web platform is to remove the friction with group controls and exporting attendance that
      professors faced through the smaller
      mobile interface. This semester, we stripped away many group controls in order to ship a better functioning MVP.
      For web, these are our initial feature
      requirements in addition to the functionality of the mobile app.
      <ul>
        <li><b>More natural interface to draft lecture questions ahead of time</b></li>
        <li><b>Seamless navigation between Pollo and exporting attendance as a CSV</b></li>
        <li><b>Customization and group controls</b>
          <ul>
            <li>Control over how to display results (i.e. displaying percentages with vs. without the answer)</li>
            <li>Setting location boundaries for where students can participate in the poll (for attendance purposes)
            </li>
            <li>Customization of scoring and participation settings (i.e. making certain questions worth more credit)
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
