    <h6>Motivation ‚ùî</h6>
    At Cornell, many professors utilize polling software such as iClickers or Learning Catalytics in class.
    They use this often in large lectures where <b>it is hard to interact with everyone in the class</b>. Some
    of the main motivations for polling during class are:
    <ul>
      <li>Taking attendance</li>
      <li>Gauging the class‚Äô understanding of material</li>
      <li>Engaging students during class in an interactive way</li>
    </ul>

    The goal of Pollo is to provide a <i>free</i> alternative to polling software through a mobile and web app.
    <br><br>
    During the Fall 2019 semester, <a href="https://www.amandamyang.com/" class="underline" target="_blank">Amanda </a>
    and I worked on improving the polling experience for students and professors based on these
    issues that were previously found during user testing:
    <ul>
      <li>Students are confused by the multiple choice question and answer flow</li>
      <li>Students and professors confuse the join class and create class interaction</li>
      <li>Professors need help on their first time creating a poll</li>
    </ul>

    To solve these pain points, we redesigned the following features:
    <ol>
      <li><a href="#mc" class="underline">Multiple choice answering interaction</a></li>
      <li><a href="#ep" class="underline">Entry points to creating vs. joining a class</a></li>
      <li><a href="#onboarding" class="underline">Onboarding for creating a poll</a></li>
    </ol>

    I also created a design system to improve consistency in our visual design and efficiency in the team's future
    workflow.

    <h2 id="multiple-choice">
      <span class="gray">01</span> Multiple choice Q&A interaction
    </h2>
    With multiple choice questions, a trend during past user testing sessions was that students were confused by the the
    content
    and visual display of the response choices and stats shown at the end. It was unclear which answer the student chose
    and
    which answer was correct, since there are many combinations of correct/incorrect/no right answer and chosen/not
    chosen by the
    student that can occur. We also reevaluated what results the student needs to see, including detailed percentage
    breakdowns,
    visual bar graph of responses and the total number of responses.
    <br><br>
    Here is the flow of the question card states that we considered at first for answering a multiple choice
    question:<br>
    <div class="pic">
      <img src="assets/pollo/mc-old.png">
    </div>
    However, with this interaction, the green color of the selected response when the poll is live can be mistaken for
    feedback that the
    choice was correct. Also, when the final results are shared with the class in the last step, the difference in color
    intensity may not
    be explicitly clear that the brighter color indicates the student‚Äôs selected response. The red/green correctness
    indicator is also not
    accessible for some colorblind students.
    <br><br>
    So, we explored different ways to show correctness and the student‚Äôs selection below.<br>
    <div class="pic">
      <img src="assets/pollo/mc-iterations.png">
    </div>

    We chose to move forward with the radio button treatment for choosing an answer since it is the most clear indicator
    of selected, and is consistent with students‚Äô mental model of multiple choice. In our final iterations we
    incorporated
    the icons to show correctness without relying solely on color. Next we continued to explore the use of percentages
    and
    bar graphs for results. <br><br>

    <div class="pic">
      <img src="assets/pollo/mc-percent-iterations.png">
    </div>
    Students want to know how they did relative to the class. The quickest way to communicate this is visually, and
    exact percentages are not necessary to convey relative performance. So, we chose <b>A</b>. <br>

    Here is the updated, full flow for answering a multiple choice question!<br>

    <h2 id="entry-points">
      <span class="gray">02</span> Entry points for creating and joining a class
    </h2>
    Another common mistake from students was accidentally creating a class instead of joining one. Previously, entry
    points
    for both actions were accessible from the home screen, regardless of whether the user is a student or professor.
    <br>
    <div class="pic">
      <img src="assets/pollo/cta-old.png">
    </div>

    Our product is a single app for both students and professors to use for their own purposes. Their primary objectives
    for polling software are very separate: either participating in joined polls, or creating polls for a class. So,
    <b>for
      different use cases, there is a different primary action.</b> Since users can toggle between their joined and
    created classes,
    I decided it would be more logical if the primary actions toggle as well, so that the ‚Äú+‚Äù icon would not be
    necessary. <br><br>

    For consistency, the primary CTA for the joined and created screens should have the same placement. But, a different
    visual
    treatment would help as a cue that the CTA is changing along with the screen‚Äôs content. So, I designed different
    ways to visually show a change
    in the primary action while staying consistent with the app‚Äôs design system.<br>
    <div class="pic">
      <img src="assets/pollo/cta-explorations.png">
    </div>

    I chose a light gray background to contrast the dark bar color on the Joined screen while
    keeping the behavior of the button consistent in inactive/active states. <br>

    <!-- ================== ONBOARDING ==================== -->

    <h2 id="onboarding">
      <span class="gray">03</span> Onboarding üö¢
    </h2>
    With creating a poll, our team designed and engineered a few features to help professors customize
    the way they create polls to fit their varying workflows. These options are not all immediately clear,
    so we wanted an onboarding flow to guide first time users through creating their first polls.
    <br><br>
    In particularly, we want professors to know that:
    <ul>
      <li>Starting a question without inputting anything will autofill with choices "A", "B", etc.</li>
      <li>Selecting an option marks it as a correct answer.</li>
      <li>You can either save the question to poll later (planning lectures in advance) or start polling on the spot.
      </li>
    </ul>
    These features are important for professors to know, as <b>they allow them to use the app to fit their
      own style of creating questions for the class</b>. Many professors like to create quick or generic A-D questions
    if the full questions
    are already incorporated in lecture slides or are written on the board. Some use polls to
    quiz students or just want to show them which answer is correct. And we also allow them to choose whether to plan
    questions as drafts or make questions to immediately start polling during lectures.
    <h6>
      Here is the final prototype.
    </h6>
    <div class="pic">
      <img src="assets/pollo/onboarding.gif">
    </div>

    <h6>
      Here is how I got there.
    </h6>
    <p>
      First, I mapped out different orderings and lengths of the onboarding flow to mimic different ways that a
      professor would create a question and determine the best way to teach the process in the app.
      They range from concise to very detailed, and vary in the ordering of customization vs. autofill.
    </p>
    <img class="pic" src="assets/onboarding-flows.png" alt="Possible onboarding flows">
    <p>

      I decided on <strong>Flow 3</strong> because it was the most comprehensive, highlighting all features without
      unecessary steps.
      It also presented the autofill option more as a secondary option to filling out each question. I chose this
      because past research showed that
      the primary use case is for professors planning out questions in advance rather than on the spot during lecture.
      Still, instructions for autofilling is very important for professors to know how to
      poll spontaneously or still use Pollo even if they have questions on lecture slides that don't fit within our
      length/format constraints to
      display on the app.
    </p>
    <h6>
      Visual explorations
    </h6>
    <p>
      I also explored how to visually highlight both the specific parts of the screen (buttons, text fields, etc.) and
      the text for
      onboarding instructions. I used a dark overlay and white outlines and text to emphasize components and provide
      context.
    </p>
    <img class="pic" src="assets/onboarding-visual.png" alt="Onboarding visual design">
    <p>
      Option A is more dynamic which brings people's attention to the buttons highlighted. But, the copy is less
      concise
      and the motion
      does not leave a good space for a "tap to continue" prompt. <br>
      Option B makes the text the primary focus with a heavier weight, fixed position, and simple copy. <br><br>
      I chose <strong>A</strong> based on feedback that the motion design (see prototype above) provides clearer focus
      on where to click
      and how to navigate. <br><br>
      <i>Further onboarding designs for the first launch of the app are in progress.</i>
