    <h6>Motivation ‚ùî</h6>
    At Cornell, many professors utilize polling software such as iClickers or Learning Catalytics in class.
    They use this often in large lectures where <b>it is hard to interact with everyone in the class</b>. Some
    of the main motivations for polling during class are:
    <ul>
      <li>Taking attendance</li>
      <li>Gauging the class‚Äô understanding of material</li>
      <li>Engaging students during class in an interactive way</li>
    </ul>

    <h6>
      The Problem üßê
    </h6>
    Widely used polling software is <strong>expensive</strong> and/or <strong>bulky.</strong><br>
    <img src="assets/pollo-problem.png" class="center" style="width: 75%;">

    <br><br>
    For students, these can be a financial burden and an annoyance to carry around or register for, especially if
    mutliple
    classes use different polling methods.
    <div class="emphasis">
      How might we create a way for professors to easily track and interact with students and for students to
      participate in classes, for free?

    <!-- ================= DESIGN SYSTEM ======================= -->

    <h2 id="design-system">
      <span class="gray">01</span> Visual Design System üé®
    </h2>
    <p>
      When I joined the team, we lacked any sort of UI kit. I did an audit of all of the visual assets in the app and
      realized many inconsistencies, especially in extra colors and text styles.</p>
    <img src="assets/pollo-old-styles.png" style="width: 50%; margin: 2em 2em 0 0; float: left;">
    <p style="margin: 4em 1em;">There were several very similar color and text styles that didn't serve a
      unique purpose in the design.
      This created an unclear visual hierarchy and difficult UI for developers to work with.</p>
    <br><br>

    <p style="clear: both;">
      After categorizing the usages of similar styles, I consolidated them into a system focusing on <b>consistency</b>
      and <b>intentionality</b>.
      I only kept those that were necessary for differentiating an essential type of content, and linked elements with a
      similar hierarchy to the same styles.<br><br>
      From there I updated the old designs using this system!<br><br>
      Finally, taking advantage of Figma's awesome nested components, I created a guide to all of the master components
      and their various
      instances. This guide can be referenced and reused by our designers, engineers, and marketing team to keep the
      Pollo app and brand on point. <br>
    </p>

    <p style="margin-top:2em;">
      This helped us <b>resolve many inconsistencies</b> in our designs/visual hierarchy and <b>organize</b> our files.
      In the future, we will use this library of styles and assets to design more efficiently and hand off clean and
      consistent designs to developers!

    <!-- ================== ONBOARDING ==================== -->

    <h2 id="onboarding">
      <span class="gray">02</span> Onboarding üö¢
    </h2>
    I also led the creation of an onboarding process for the first time a user
    makes a poll to walk them through all of their customization options.<br><br>
    Particularly, we want users to know that:
    <ul>
      <li>Starting a question without inputting anything will autofill with choices "A", "B", etc.</li>
      <li>Selecting an option marks it as a correct answer.</li>
      <li>You can either save the question to poll later (planning lectures in advance) or start polling on the spot.
      </li>
    </ul>
    These features are important for professors to know, as <b>they allow them to use the app to fit their
      own style of creating questions for the class</b>. Many professors like to create quick or generic A-D questions
    if the full questions
    are already incorporated in lecture slides or are written on the board. Some use polls to
    quiz students or just want to show them which answer is correct. And we also allow them to choose whether to plan
    questions as drafts or make
    questions in the moment during lectures.
    <h6>
      Here is the final prototype.
    </h6>
    <video width="100%" controls>
      <source src="assets/onboarding-video.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>
    <h6>
      Here is how I got there.
    </h6>
    <p>
      First, I mapped out different orderings and lengths of the onboarding flow to mimic different ways that a
      professor would create a
      question and determine the best way to teach the process in the app. They range from concise to very detailed, and
      vary in the
      ordering of customization vs. autofill.
    </p>
    <img class="pic" src="assets/onboarding-flows.png">

    <p>
      I decided on <strong>Flow 3</strong> because it was the most comprehensive, highlighting all features without
      unecessary steps.
      It also presented the autofill option more as a secondary option to filling out each question. I chose this
      because prior research showed that
      the primary use case is for professors planning out questions in advance rather than on the spot during lecture.
      Still, instructions for autofilling is very important for professors to know how to
      poll spontaneously or still use Pollo even if they have questions on lecture slides that don't fit within our
      length/format constraints to
      display on the app.
    </p>
    <h6>
      Visual explorations
    </h6>
    <p>
      I also explored how to visually highlight both the specific parts of the screen (buttons, text fields, etc.) and
      the text for
      onboarding instructions. I used a dark overlay and white outlines and text to emphasize components and provide
      context.
    </p>
    <img class="pic" src="assets/onboarding-visual.png">
    <p>
      Option A is more dynamic which brings users' attention to the buttons highlighted. But, the copy is less concise
      and the motion
      does not leave a good space for a "tap to continue" prompt. <br>
      Option B makes the text the primary focus with a heavier weight, fixed position, and simple copy. <br><br>
      I chose <strong>A</strong> based on feedback that the motion design (see prototype above) provides clearer focus
      on where to click
      and how to navigate. <br><br>

    <h2 id="web">
      <span class="gray">03</span> Designing Pollo for web üíª
    </h2>
    <p>
      We surveyed 11 professors about how they use polling in their classes to learn how
      to get Pollo used in classrooms. Here are the key insights we gained.
      <ul>
        <li><b>Professors need different ways to customize the way they score poll responses.</b>
          Professors use polling for a mix of participation and grading purposes</li>
        <li><b>Almost all professors plan questions for a lecture in advance.</b> They usually
          prepare polls in a slide deck before the lecture.</li>
        <li><b>A desktop interface is important to professors.</b> Desktops allow better,
          more visual display of graphs and results.</li>
      </ul>
      To address professors' desire for more group controls and hesitance to allow phones in class, we are currently
      working
      on building a Pollo web app.<br><br>
      Our main goal for a web platform is to remove the friction with group controls and exporting attendance that
      professors faced through the smaller
      mobile interface. (This semester, we stripped away many group controls on mobile in order to ship a better
      functioning MVP.)
      <br><br>For web, we plan to start by creating a basic way to download attendance data, as this is an essential
      part of why professors use polls, and it can only be done feasibly on a desktop.
      Later, we will build the functionality of the mobile app in addition to these initial
      web feature requirements:
